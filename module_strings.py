Welcome to the Mount&Blade: Napoleonic Wars tutorial, my good man!^ Now, to begin your training, use the 'WASD' keys to walk to the position indicated by the pointer arrow. You can use the mouse to look around, all the better to spot the French with! Eh? Bleeehaha!"),
 ("tutorial_info_2","See that glorious piece of British engineering in front of you?  Look at the musket  and press 'F' to pick it up!"),
 ("tutorial_info_3","Wonderful! You are armed, sir! Now let us do some damage to those targets in front of you.^Hold down the left mouse button to aim your musket and use your mouse to change the direction of your aim. Note that muskets are somewhat unpredictable, or more to the point, frightfully inaccurate. Bleahaha!^Once you are happy with your aim, you may proceed to let go of the left mouse button in order to fire!"),
 ("tutorial_info_4","Bad luck! It seems you have missed the target. Time to reload your weapon and try again.^ To reload, click the left mouse button and wait for your character to finish reloading - it will take a couple of seconds so be patient. Remember though, you cannot move while reloading.^Once you have reloaded, take another shot at hitting the targets. Do not worry if you miss, you can always reload and try again."),
 ("tutorial_info_5","Well done sir! Now, if you wish, you may keep practicing;^ otherwise, if you feel you have gotten the hang of firing, you may move on to the next area on the left, where the arrow is pointing."),
 ("tutorial_info_6","Well done sir! If you wish, sir, you may reload your weapon and fire again.^ To reload, click the left mouse button and wait for your character to finish reloading - it will take a couple of seconds so be patient. Remember though, you cannot move while reloading.^Once you feel that you have gotten the hang of it, you may move on to the next area on the left, where the arrow is pointing."),
 ("tutorial_info_7","There are times in battle when it is preferable to get up close and personal with old Frenchie, and that is why your musket is equipped with a bayonet.^However, your musket is currently in 'firing mode'; to use the bayonet you need to change to 'melee mode'. The button to toggle between the modes is 'X'. Press it now."),
 ("tutorial_info_8","Excellent. You are now in melee mode and ready to charge those dummies with your bayonet.^BUT! Before you do that, there is another important matter you should know about.^You do not have to stand up all the time, you can also crouch. Press 'Z' to do so."),
 ("tutorial_info_9","Good! As you can see you are now crouching. Since you are also in 'melee mode' you can see that your character is bracing his bayonet. This is very effective against frontal cavalry attacks.^Rise up to continue. To do so, either press 'Z' again or simply use any of the movement keys."),
 ("tutorial_info_10","Now on to attacking and defending. To attack, press the left mouse button while moving the mouse in the direction you wish to attack. Your bayoneted musket only has two directions: up and down. Other weapons may have other directions. Swords, for example, have four attack directions: up, down, left and right. To release your attack, let go of the left mouse button.^Defense works in a similar fashion. Hold the right mouse button while moving the mouse in the direction you wish to block. All weapons can block in all four directions. Make sure you are blocking your enemy's attack from the right direction, or the frogs will make quick work of you.^^Now practice with your bayonet by destroying all the dummies in the area."),
 ("tutorial_info_11","Well done!"),
 ("tutorial_info_12","Now that you have mastered the basics of infantry combat, we will move on to cavalry.^You have been given some rather splendidly polished equipment and a magnificent horse. To mount said horse, walk up to it and press 'F'."),
 ("tutorial_info_13","So you have mounted up? Excellent. To move while mounted you will maintain the use of the 'WASD' keys, but the basics of movement is slightly different: 'W' will increase your speed and 'S' will decrease it; while 'A' and 'D' will turn your horse. By moving the mouse you may look around - but doing so will not automatically turn the horse. Try this now by moving to were the arrow points."),
 ("tutorial_info_14","Marvelous! Now bring the horse to a stop. It is time to do some horseback shooting. See those targets in the distance? Shooting on horseback is very similar to shooting on foot, so use what you have learned before to hit any one of the targets."),
 ("tutorial_info_15","Oh hell and buckshot! You have missed! Do not worry though, you can reload and try again, just as before. But remember, the rule that you have to be still while firing counts on horseback as well. You can try again, once you have reloaded your firearm."),
 ("tutorial_info_16","Now you have got it! You can keep practicing some more, if you wish.^^Once you are ready to proceed, we will cover the basic joys of horseback melee. You will require a sword for this. To switch to the sword, scroll your mouse wheel upwards."),
 ("tutorial_info_17","Bravo! You can keep firing if you wish. Just remember, the rule that you have to be stationary while firing counts on horseback as well.^^Once you are ready to proceed, we will cover the basic joys of horseback melee. You will require a sword for this. To switch to the sword, scroll your mouse wheel upwards."),
 ("tutorial_info_18","Just like shooting, melee fighting on horseback is similar to fighting on foot. So ride alongside those dummies and destroy them.^Try to hit them while maintaining movement, as standing still takes away your advantage in speed and maneuverability. If you time your strikes right, you can hit the enemy and be well away before the blighter even knows he is dead."),
 ("tutorial_info_19","Splendid! You now know the most important aspects of cavalry fighting."),
 ("tutorial_info_20","Finally! It is time for some artillery training.^Walk up to the cannon and take some ammunition from the box.^^There are three main types of ammunition:^Round shot is a multi-purpose shot that is especially useful against buildings;^Canister shots release a hail of grapeshot that kills anyone right in front of the cannon, but it is notoriously ineffective at hitting long rang targets;^Explosive shells are extremely effective against enemy troops, as they explode sending metal fragments flying in all directions. Explosive shells however, are not available for standard cannons."),
 ("tutorial_info_21","Put the ammunition into the barrel from the front of the cannon. To do so, look at the front, once you see the text 'Place Ammunition', hold down 'F' until the progress bar reaches the end."),
 ("tutorial_info_22","Now you need to use your ramrod to reload the cannon. Again, look at the front of the barrel and hold 'F' until done."),
 ("tutorial_info_23","Before you can fire, you will want to push the cannon forward. To do so, look at it and hold down 'F'."),
 ("tutorial_info_24","Finally, look at the back of the barrel until you see the message 'Take Control'. Then press 'F' to take control of the cannon."),
 ("tutorial_info_25","Now you control the cannon sir! Again, use the mouse to aim. Pressing the Left Mouse Button will fire the cannon and pressing the Right Mouse Button will cancel control, but for now, press the LMB to fire."),
 ("tutorial_info_26","This is the end of the tutorial. You now know all the basics of fighting in Mount&Blade: Napoleonic Wars. Press 'Tab' to leave this tutorial when you are ready.^^Good luck on the battlefield, sir! Dismissed for tea and crumpets!"),

  ("mission_briefing_1", "December 1, 1805^\
It was a fine respite, but now we march once again. Praise God this will be our final effort! ^\
It is said that we shall march directly into the battle.^\
^\
Our time on the outskirts of Vienna was surely the finest days of the campaign. Rich villages ^\
with large, clean houses, wonderful food and wine -- and of course the pretty girls all helped us ^\
replenish our energies.^\
We had been shaken by the endless marches through terrible weather. Exhausted by our pursuit ^\
of the retreating Allied forces. It was good to forget, for a little while.^\
^\
But our peaceful rest ended abruptly; we received the order to rejoin the main army as quickly as ^\
possible, and now we march madly to battle once more. In a forced march we have left nearly half ^\
of the regiment behind, but general Friant is determined to arrive to the battlefield on time, ^\
and will not pause for our supporting forces to rejoin us.^\
^\
The Allies are said to greatly outnumber our own troops, especially in cavalry. It seems that the ^\
battle will be defensive this time, but the situation remains unclear. A messenger from the Emperors ^\
headquarters informed us, as he rode past our column, that our rear guard had been driven back ^\
near a place called Vishau, and were retreating towards Austerlitz^\
^\
I dare not speak of it, but thoughts of the upcoming battle fill me with terror. Marengo was the last ^\
Well, I should say the only large battle I took part in, and this was almost 5 years ago. I still ^\

  # Drezden
  ("mission_briefing_3", "August 26, 1813^\
We are preparing to march on Drezden, where our small garrison was formerly besieged by the far ^\
superior forces of the Allies. Artillery fire is reported to be so powerful that window glass ^\
shakes even 10 kilometers from the city.^\
^\
The original plan was to raid and disrupt Allied communications, ^\
but the Emperor revised his plan two days ago when he learned of a threat on the Saxon capital. ^\
When he discovered the scale of the threat, he sent us to save the city, while the bulk of his ^\
forces proceeded with General Vandamme to continue with the raid as originally planned.^\
It is no surprise that the Allied forces will attempt to seize Dresden. Its defenses are miserable, ^\
and the garrison is quite insufficient. But Napoleon intends to give the Allies an unpleasant ^\
surprise of their own, for the Allies are not scouting anywhere near the area that we are approaching from.^\
^\
We have a strong force, and numerous cavalry guided by Prince Murat himself. Unfortunately, ^\
the weather seems to be getting worse and worse, and it probably will be raining by the time ^\
we reach Dresden. Under such circumstances, the benefits we might reap from our superior cavalry ^\
will significantly decrease.^\
^\
Myself, I welcome the battle. Finally we may take our revenge upon the Russians, for what we have ^\
suffered these past six months. I have tried to forget what horrors we witnessed on the way from ^\
Moscow to Berezina, but the images still come unbidden to my mind. These nightmares shall likely ^\
pursue me to the end of my days. ^\
We must win this battle, and this war, that our comrades shall not have died in vain."),
  
  # Shevardino
  ("mission_briefing_4", "September 5, 1812^\
^\
I grow tired of this war. The march has been tolerable, but the past few days were difficult, ^\
and I am only now recovering from an illness. Blast, the climate is terrible! Scorching hot days, ^\
cold nights, dry air. There are no more Russian peasants to be seen. Theyâ€™ve burned their houses and fled, ^\
leaving little to sustain us on the long march towards Moscow.^\
^\
Our men grow tired as well. For too long, they have been biting at the heels of a fleeing enemy. ^\
But they are cheerful that the march is nearing its end, and gladly greet the coming battle. ^\
We call the Russians cowards, and imagine a swift victory, that we may return to the arms of our loved ones. ^\
Our soldiers even ask permission to wear parade uniforms into the battle. Our hopes and weariness have ^\
blinded us: the men do not see that the most difficult challenge is yet to come.^\
^\
Meanwhile, the Russian soldiers have halted their retreat, and instead are digging in for the final stand.^\
^\
Their preparations are covered by a great redoubt at Shevardino. It is well away from their rear positions, ^\
which makes it a fine target. Marshall Davout has received orders to capture the redoubt as quickly as ^\
possible. I am to join the troops of General Compans in this attack, to ensure that everything goes as planned.^\
^\
But I am wary. Never before have I seen such fortifications! I have grown certain that these Russians ^\
are no cowards. ^\
They will retreat no further, but will defend their Moscow to the dying breath."),
